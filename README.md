## 🚀 Key Features

- **🧍 Vision Transformer-Based Monitoring**  
  Uses Vision Transformers (ViT) to analyze patient posture and skin condition from images for early detection and tracking.

- **💬 Medical Chatbot**  
  LLM-powered chatbot to understand symptoms, answer health queries, and provide advice using LangChain.

- **📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  Integrates relevant medical literature to ensure reliable and current medical responses.

- **📱 Mobile App Interface**  
  Built with Expo (React Native) for a seamless experience in symptom logging and chatbot interactions.

- **⌚ (Planned) Wearable Data Integration**  
  Future integration of wearable device data for real-time monitoring and alerts.
